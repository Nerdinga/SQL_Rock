# SQL_Rock
This is a project about movie rental company and my SQL queries for it.

Rockbuster Stealth’s business intelligence department requests help with the launch strategy for the new online video service. I first loaded all of Rockbuster’s data into a relational database management system. Then, I used SQL to analyze the data and answer ad-hoc business questions.
